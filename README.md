UZI is a set of vide components that wraps around basic instrict elements like Frame current it's in version 0.1.0 so theres no image labels and text box

```tsx
				<Frame color={new Color3(1, 1, 1)}>
					<Corner radius={new UDim(0.5)} />
					<Border thickness={new UDim(0, 5)} color={new Color3(0, 0, 0)} />
				</Frame>
```
Frame's default size is 100x100 px and they are centered in by default with anchorpoint and position so this would look like this
